Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS)
Autonomous Decentralized Systems (ADS) is a design paradigm that enables the creation of decentralized systems composed of independent modules capable of operating autonomously and interacting with each other. This repository showcases the concept of ADS and provides examples of its applications in various fields such as industrial production, robotics, and service systems.

Introduction
ADS offers a robust and fault-tolerant approach to system design by allowing components to function independently while collectively working towards the overall system goals. This decentralized nature ensures that the system remains operational even in the event of component failures. Additionally, maintenance and repair can be carried out without interrupting the system's functionality.

Features
Decentralization: The system is composed of autonomous modules that operate independently.
Interoperability: Modules can interact with each other to achieve the system's overall goals.
Fault Tolerance: The system can continue to function even if individual components fail.
Operational Maintenance: Maintenance and repair can be performed while the system remains operational.
Expanded Applications: ADS can be applied in various domains, including industrial production lines, robotics, and service systems.
